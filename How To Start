My Shopping Cart is an application where we dynamically apply discounts on shopping cart items, based
on their category. Besides, based on the total cart value, the program should be able to
apply a final slab-wise discount.
For simplicity, and to work around database portability, assume the shopping cart data to
be available in XML/ JSON format.
For every item added in the shopping cart, apply the discount based on the category of the
item being added. Likewise, based on all added items, (& their associated discounts
applied), calculate the grand total, based on 3 parameters: (Unit Price, Quantity, & its
applicable discount) – for each item. Apply a final slab based discount on the grand total, to
generate the net bill value.
Inputs, to the program:
1. XML/ JSON – List of Shopping Item categories, and their applicable discount %
2. XML/ JSON – List of items in shopping cart, their associated information, including
their shopping category
3. XML/ JSON – Grand total slabs, & their applicable discount %
Outputs from the program:
1. Itemized bill – listing each purchase item, its quantity, unit price, discount, and net
purchase amount for that item, (& quantity)
2. Grand total, applicable discount, and Net Bill Amount.




To check the output,
1. Please open MainShoppingCart.java and run it.
2. Change the discount and price in the xml and test again.
